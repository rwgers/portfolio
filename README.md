# This portfolio
Interactive personal portfolio with responsive design.

## Inspiration & Sources
* The core of this project uses **[Whole page slider](https://github.com/elansx/Wholepage-Slider)**, an Slider for creating one page website.
  * Here I modified to code in order to slide and keep the track of the top and bottom slider.
  
* The SVG shapes are from **[codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2018/01/24/gradient-topography-animation/)**.
  * With the SVGs ready I tried to replicate the same animation.

Hope you enjoy this little portfolio.
